"Dear Jessica,

I found your profile on LinkedIn and wanted to reach out to discuss potentially working together. I’m currently pursuing my master’s in Computer Science at San Jose State University, with five years of experience, and seeking SDE Internship Opportunities for Summer’22.

I have taken up courses like Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Cryptography and Computer Security, NoSQL Databases as a part of my course work and have done projects on them.

As a part of my professional tenure at Pegasystems, I have experience in building scalable large-scale applications and in developing end-to-end web applications. I have worked on developing adaptive and predictive models.

Working for an organization like Google would be a dream come true and I would like to give my best for it.

I have already applied for the Software Engineer Intern position at Google and the application is under review.

I’d love to chat about whether my background might be a fit for any of your openings, and I’d also be happy to connect you with other professionals in my field.
